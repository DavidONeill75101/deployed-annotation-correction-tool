                        <li>Some of these predictions are incorrect - it is your mission is to review them.</li>
                        <li>A prediction is made based upon a sentence annotation and consists of a cancer, gene, drug (optional) and type of relation.</li>
                        <li>If the sentence annotation is valid for the given relation then give it a "thumbs up".</li>

                        <li>If you know how the incorrect annotation should be fixed, you can manually annotate the sentence to identify the true relation.</li>

                <div>
                    The <a href="http://bionlp.bcgsc.ca/civicmine/">CIViCMine</a> BioNLP platform predicts relations between genes, cancers and drugs.
                    By identifying these relations in biomedical literature the tool hopes to aid the field of precision oncology, the main benefit being that researchers do not need to trawl through many research papers to identify relations.
                    Simply, CIViCMine does the heavy lifting by predicting these relations automatically.
                    As with all machine learning tools, however, CIViCMine inevitably makes inaccurate predictions.
                    The purpose of this application is to review these predictions and make corrections if necessary.
                    With these reviews and corrections, new training data can be generated to improve the CIViCMine training process and ultimately produce more accurate predictions.

                        <li>The CIViCMine tool reads a sentence taken from biomedical literature and identifies whether it illustrates the presence of a relation.</li>
                        <li>A relation will consist of entities and an evidence type.</li>
                        <li>An entity can be a type of gene, cancer or drug which is present in the sentence.</li>
                        <li>An evidence type outlines the type of relationship which exists between these entities.</li>

                            <li>You can filter this list to only view specific types of relation, based upon your areas of expertise.</li>

                            <li>You will be presented with the sentences in which this relation was identified.</li>
                            <li>For each sentence, you have the ability to either <em>upvote</em> or <em>downvote</em>, signifying whether you believe this sentence indicates the presence of the relation accurately.</li>

                            <li>When annotating a sentence, you will begin by identifying entities.  To do this, select the type of entity you wish to identify using the dropdown menu and then highlight the area of text which displays the entity.</li>
                            <li>You can highlight gene, cancer, drug or variant entities.</li>

                            <li>To define a relation, select the entities and evidence type from the dropdown menus - these will only be populated with the entities that you have highlighted.</li>
                            <li>The dropdown menus will also indicate whether the entity you have chosen has a more well-known synonym.</li>
                            <li>Select to add the relation using the button below, ensuring that the relation follows the rules described above - e.g. a predictive relation must have a gene, cancer and drug entity identified.</li>
                            <li>If you have highlighted an entity in the text and you would like to specify its more commonly known synonym, you can add an entity link.</li>
                            <li>This can be done by looking at the entity link table, selecting the entity you highlighted and the more common synonym.</li>
                            <li>Once you are satisfied that you have identified all entities and relations, you can save your annotations.</li>
